Here's the Python code for finding factorial of a number:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

This function recursively calculates the factorial of a number `n` by calling itself with `n-1` until it reaches the base case of `n=0`. 

You can call the function by passing a number as an argument, like this:

```python
print(factorial(5)) # Output: 120
``` 

The above code will print the factorial of 5 which is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.
